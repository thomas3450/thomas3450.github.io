        <div class="box box2">In shooter games (or simply shooters), players use ranged weapons to participate in the action, which takes place at a distance. Most shooters involve violent gameplay; lethal weaponry is used to damage opponents. However, some shooters, such as Splatoon, have non-violent objectives.
          Shooters, aside from subgenre classifications, can be further classified by their perspective of play.  First person shooters are played within the protagonistâ€™s perspective; they often include a heads-up display displaying key information such as the current health of the protagonist. In third-person-shooters, the protagonist's body can be seen fully; the environment is rendered from a distance. Some shooters incorporate both perspectives. Since the 1990s, shooters, most notably first-person shooters, have become widely successful in video gaming, accounting for a large percentage of video game sales. </div>
